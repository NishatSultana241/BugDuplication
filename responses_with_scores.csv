Response from Llava,Similarity Score
"Based on the symptoms described, I would estimate a similarity score of 0.7. Both images show a user interface with a two-factor authentication app, which is the primary functionality of Aegis Authenticator. The similarity is high because both images are related to the same app and share a common purpose.",0.7
"Based on the symptoms provided, the cosine similarity score between the two bug reports would be quite high, likely around 0.9 or 1. This is because both reports describe the same issue with the Aegis Authenticator app, including the problem of a blank screen with a red button, the inability to log in, and the need to reinstall the app. The similarity in the symptoms and the context of the issue suggests that these are two different instances of the same problem.",
"The similarity score for these bug reports is 0.85.

This score is calculated using the following logic:

1. **UI Broken**: Both bug reports mention that the UI is broken. The app's behavior when set to the system default language results in UI issues, which is consistent across both reports.

2. **Language Handling**: Both reports mention that the code generated by the app is wrong when using system default language, especially when set to right to left languages like Arabic. This is a critical issue that both reports agree on.

3. **Code Validity**: Both reports state that the generated code is not valid. This is a critical issue that both reports share.

4. **User Experience**: Both reports mention that there are beginner issues, suggesting that the user is new to the development process or the app itself.

5. **Code Sharing**: One report explicitly states the user has shared the code, which is a detail that both reports share.
